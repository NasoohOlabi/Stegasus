Alice: ` Hi, do you want to chat about Mars? Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman God of War and is often referred to as the Red Planet.`
Bob: ` I would say that Mars is a fierce looking neighbor, but probably the friendliest planet at least for humans. Second to earth, that is.`
Alice: ` Yes, I agree, it's reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.`
Bob: ` I think the red is clear from a distance, but up close, it's not quite so red. Plus I bet the atmosphere changes the appearance of a lot of things. And sound, too.`
Alice: ` Well, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surfaces like the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.`
Bob: ` Mars has an atmosphere, but it makes the sunsets blue, I believe. Not really breathable. `
Alice: ` Yes, due to the differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.`
Bob: ` That would make us sound funny! Like helium balloons do. Still, I would rather live my life on Earth. I know that with fast travel, we could get to Mars fast. But what would you do there?`
Alice: ` If you change your mind, a Mars colonization project is planned for 2023 and will be funded by creating a reality TV show.`
Bob: ` I would not want to be the first there. Couldn't pay me enough.`
Alice: ` If you would fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration, it will only take 2 or 3 days to get there.`
Bob: ` That is still quite a while for regular business trips. And in economy class? Forget about it.`
Alice: ` I agree. Only the lichens and cyanobateria would be able to thrive on Mars anyway.`
Bob: ` I guess we could put atmosphere converters there and give it a few decades to shift to oxygen. Maybe it would be habitable.`
Alice: ` Depends on a lot of factors.  Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system while NASA used the metric system. `
Bob: ` That was a serious oversight. How can scientists and engineers ever use that outdated system? I'm surprised. `
Alice: ` Talk about crazy, did you know that more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed?`
Bob: ` We are destroying our home so fast. Can we put forests on Mars? Doubtful. We can't even do it here.`
Alice: ` Good point, did you know also that earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century?`
Bob: ` Yes, we'll have to get it from fusion reactors or from the sun. Whichever is easier. Anyway, great chat!`
Alice: ` Yes, great chat!`
