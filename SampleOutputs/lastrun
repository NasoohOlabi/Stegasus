Alice: `What do you think of the Paleo diet for kids?`
Bob: `Hello! I think there should be some restrictions but not low carb if it's a good carb, Gluten free is good though I think.`
Alice: `yeah I don't think they necessarily need to be on a low carb diet.  Gluten free isn't bad if they have health reasons for needing to do that I suppose`
Bob: ` I think kids tend to take diets to the extreme sometimes. Not good because they need balance since they are growing. `
Alice: `Yes, I believe we should focus on feeding them healthy whole grains, fruits and vegatables and that way they will grow to choose better choices`
Bob: `Yes. good carbs fuel the brain and give you energy which kids need a lot of. They need a vast variety of these vitamins and minerals.`
Alice: `You want them to appreciate food and healthy food choices so they won't have a unhealthy relationship with food when they are older.  If we are always having them on a diet as a kid then they might go crazy and make bad choices later on in life`
Bob: `Exactly, and with all the celebrity influence it's vital they learn from parents what a healthy way of life and eating is not just about your size and shape.`
Alice: `I agree.  speaking of celebrities..Robin Williams in Aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films`
Bob: `That's very interesting! Did you know Miley Cyrus' real name is Destiny Hope? I like that better.`
Alice: `yes that is actually really pretty.  She also has a nickname of "smiley""`
Bob: `Yes! That's why she goes by Miley lol very cute. Her Godmother is Dolly Parton too that's awesome.`
Alice: `That is pretty neat.  Her brother is also famous.  He is the lead guitarist and backing vocal in metro stataion`
Bob: `Wow, that family is talented for sure! Her Dad Billy Ray has been very famous as well but I haven't heard about him in awhile.`
Alice: `yeah they starred in the Disney Channel show Hannah Montana`
Bob: `I know and it seems so many of today's talent has come from being in t.v shows. and many from the Disney channel.`
Alice: `I know thats true.  She was also in a film called Big Fish`
Bob: `Was she? I didn't know that. It's crazy that her hit Wrecking Ball was co written by 5 different people. She has had many hits.`
Alice: `Also party in the USA was originally written by Jessie J and intended for Jessie J`
Bob: `Right? It's funny how things work out. Just like Eminem originally was going to be a comic book artist....I am sure he's happy now that he followed his  alternate dream`
Alice: `in 2001 a michigan judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap when trying a suit filed against him`
Bob: `Really? haha, I would have liked to have heard that! Eminem has had an amazing career. Tupac has music is in the library of congress.`
Alice: `yes that had to be funny.  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle, it called "compliment battle"`
Bob: ` That would be cool to watch. So many different styles these days! It has been great chatting with you! `
Alice: `yes you too`
Bob: `Have a happy New Year!`
Alice: `you too`
Bob: `Thanks!`

Alice: `Hi, do you like to travel?`
Bob: `I used to.  Nowadays travel has gotten too cramped and unpleasant for me.  Do you like to travel?`
Alice: `I love traveling. Did you know the Dutch are creating a bus that can travel 160mph?`
Bob: `Whew, that thing goes fast.  Not sure if I'd be riding it.`
Alice: `Me either lol. To travel across Japan, it would cost roughly $300 in tolls.`
Bob: ` Actually, I've been to Japan a few times on business, back when I traveled frequently and that's true, all their roads are tolls. `
Alice: `That's pretty cool. Have you ever been to Mackinac Island?`
Bob: `In Maine?`
Alice: `In Michigan. They banned motorized vehicles for over a hundred years.`
Bob: `I've been there once, it was a few years back and it's quite odd not to hear and see cars moving about.  It's awfully quaint.`
Alice: `That would be cool to visit. Did you know Iceland has no public rail system and most people travel by air there?`
Bob: `No, I didn't know that.  I've never been to Iceland.  Have you?`
Alice: `I have never been to Iceland. Did you like it there?`
Bob: `I don't think I'd like it there, too cold and I would not sit cramped up on a flight just to travel between their cities.  lol`
Alice: `Me either. Did you know Cadillac was named after a French explorer?`
Bob: `Is he the explorer that founded Detroit?`
Alice: `Yep, he also founded Detroit which is pretty interesting.`
Bob: `Yes, it is!`
Alice: `Did you know the trunk of a car was named that because older cars actually had wooden trunks in them?`
Bob: `That makes sense to me!`
Alice: `It was good talking to you!`

Alice: `If only I were in DC, I'd have twelve things to do.  I'll have to make a note for next time I'm there.`
Bob: `Looks like they have a lot of fun there. There's a Winter Olympic celebration where you're supposed to wear Olympic sports gear or ski attire.`
Alice: `I hope it is not in the summer, it can very hot and sticky, it is built on a swamp.`
Bob: `Haha, right. There's also a Chinese New Year Festival at the Smithsonian with CHinese acrobats, opera and more. Sounds neat.`
Alice: `I'm not sure if the drag queens are my thing, I might have to give that one a pass.`
Bob: `Haha, I think that would be fun, a unique Valentine's dinner where they pour drinks and serve dinner!`
Alice: `A long time ago I saw one of the newer Star Wars movie in DC, we went as much to escape the heat as wanting to see the movie.`
Bob: ` I hear you. It's hot where I live. Star Wars as a combined box office revenue of over 8.5 billion! `
Alice: `Must be up there with the Harry Potter movies and those Marvel ones.  I used to love it when I was a kids, saw the first movie five times on the big screen`
Bob: `It's also the most successful film merchandising franchise. Do you have a lot of Star Wars merchandise?`
Alice: `When I was a kid I had a lot, some of it might have been worth something now but my dad threw it all out when I moved out.`
Bob: `Bummer, haha! Did you know at one point 20th Century Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop?`
Alice: `Even if they had thought it might do well I can't imagine that anyone could have imagine the cultural phenomenon it would become, even George Lucas.`
Bob: `Yeah, but George Lucas did have faith. He waived his $500k directing fee in return for licensing and merchandising rights and that made him a billionaire!`
Alice: `There a few stories like that from the movie, I understand Alec Guinness got a share of the merchandising rights too.  And then there is the voice of Vader, James Earl Jones who got just $7,500.`
Bob: `Yeah, and interesting how James Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry after he watched Star Wars.`
Alice: `He had a more proactive response than me.  When I saw Star Wars all I did was buy another ticket to see it again.  I guess I just don't have the right attitude.`
Bob: `Hahah, right? So according to George Lucas, the entire Star Wars saga is told by r2d2 a hundred years after return of the jedi. I'm not sure I knew that.`
Alice: `That's too much detail for me.  I know some people get really into it and dissect every detail.  I'm happy to watch the movie and then move on with my life.  Like what can I do in DC next time I'm there.`
Bob: `I'd like to see David Bowie's band in DC. They are back out on the road.`
Alice: `I've been to the Black Cat in Dc, it holds about 100 people, can't imagine they would play there.`
Bob: `Interesting. I'd like it if it was a small crowd in that setting. Well, going to listen to some music now. Enjoy your night!`
