Alice:`What do you think of the Paleo diet for kids?`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`Hello! I think there should be some restrictions but not low carb if it's a good carb, Gluten free is good though I think.`
__________________________________________________

Alice:`yeah I don't think they necessarily need to be on a low carb diet.  Gluten free isn't bad if they have health reasons for needing to do that I suppose`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`I think kids tend to take diets to the extreme sometimes. Not good because they need balance since they are growing.`
__________________________________________________

Alice:`Yes, I believe we should focus on feeding them healthy whole grains, fruits and vegatables and that way they will grow to choose better choices`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`Yes. good carbs fuel the brain and give you energy which kids need a lot of. They need a vast variety of these vitamins and minerals.`
__________________________________________________

Alice:`You want them to appreciate food and healthy food choices so they won't have a unhealthy relationship with food when they are older.  If we are always having them on a diet as a kid then they might go crazy and make bad choices later on in life`

Bob:`Exactly, and with all the celebrity influence it's vital they learn from parents what a healthy way of life and eating is not just about your size and shape.`

Alice:`I agree.  speaking of celebrities..Robin Williams in Aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films`

Alice:`I know thats true.  She was also in a film called Big Fish`
