Alice:`Hi, do you like to travel?`

Bob:`I used to.  Nowadays travel has gotten too cramped and unpleasant for me.  Do you like to travel?`

Alice:`I love traveling. Did you know the Dutch are creating a bus that can travel 160mph?`

Bob:`Whew, that thing goes fast.  Not sure if I'd be riding it.`

Alice:`Me either lol. To travel across Japan, it would cost roughly $300 in tolls.`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`Actually, I've been to Japan a few times on business, back when I traveled frequently and that's true, all their roads are tolls.`

Alice:`That's pretty cool. Have you ever been to Mackinac Island?`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`In Maine?`
__________________________________________________

Alice:`In Michigan. They banned motorized vehicles for over a hundred years.`

Bob:`I've been there once, it was a few years back and it's quite odd not to hear and see cars moving about.  It's awfully quaint.`

Alice:`That would be cool to visit. Did you know Iceland has no public rail system and most people travel by air there?`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`No, I didn't know that.  I've never been to Iceland.  Have you?`
__________________________________________________

Alice:`I have never been to Iceland. Did you like it there?`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`I don't think I'd like it there, too cold and I would not sit cramped up on a flight just to travel between their cities.  lol`

Alice:`Me either. Did you know Cadillac was named after a French explorer?`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`Is he the explorer that founded Detroit?`
__________________________________________________

Alice:`Yep, he also founded Detroit which is pretty interesting.`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`Yes, it is!`
__________________________________________________

Alice:`Did you know the trunk of a car was named that because older cars actually had wooden trunks in them?`
__________________________________________________

Bob:`That makes sense to me!`

Alice:`It was good talking to you!`
